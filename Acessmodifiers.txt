- There are four types of access specifiers in Java: 

    i) public: A public class, method, or data member is visible to all classes. 
    ii) protected: A protected class, method, or data member can be accessed by classes within the same
    package, and any subclasses which extend the class. 
    iii) default: A default class, method, or data member is visible only to classes
    within the same package. 
    iv) private: A private class, method, or data member is only visible to the class it is declared in, 
    and not to any subclasses.
